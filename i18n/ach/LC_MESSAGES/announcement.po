"will be delivered as early media if the channel supports that. When not "
"checked, the channel is answered followed by a 1 second delay. When using an "
"announcement from an IVR or other sources that have already answered the "
"channel, that 1 second delay may not be desired."

"If this announcement came from an IVR and this box is checked, the "
